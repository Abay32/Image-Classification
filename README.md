# Imgage Classification

This two notebooks apply neural network approach to classifie images based on the trianed data. 
The steps we follow are highlighted as follows

    - The data is imported from the tensorflow dataset (tdfs).

    - We prepare the data
        - Get train-test data
        - convert the image data to numpy array
        - Reshape the array

    - Normalize the data

    - Train with basic neural network

    - Add convolutional layer

    - Hyperparameter tuning
    
    - compile the model
    
    - Finaly evaluate the choosen model with test data set
